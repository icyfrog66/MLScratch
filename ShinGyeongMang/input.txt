I am in my third year of a four year PhD, and I'm at the stage where I basically work from home. I'm starting to feel in a bit of a rut in my sweaters and leggings. I do usually get out at least once per day, but even then it's a casual run to the store or just working at a coffee shop for the change of scenery. I get very excited for these outings and try to dress up, but in the end I still need to be comfortable if I'm going to sit in Starbucks for four hours. How do you deal with a work from home rut? I'm thinking the answer is to elevate my basics and loungewear (I just bought a silk t-shirt on Amazon so I'll let you know later how that goes), but that's starting to look like an expensive investment for things I'm truly going to just sit on the couch in... Edit: Wow, thanks for all the great replies! I just checked during my (wfh) lunch break to find I must have struck a nerve! Seems like everyone has a different way of dealing with this issue and I definitely appreciate all of the tips and conversation!
